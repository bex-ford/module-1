## Description

- My motivation for this project was to ensure that when visiting the website it follows accessibility standards and that the site was optimized for search engines. 

- I built this project because i wanted to ensure that users with disabilities or impairments were able to visit the website without difficulty ensuring there user experience is of a high standard. 

- The problem this code solves is that it allows users with disabilities the best user experience:

***I modified the code to ensure it follows the current HTML semantics in order so the code is legible and clean:***

- I started by adding the ***header*** element at the beginning of the ***body*** tag as this is introductory content. 

- I removed a div tag and replaced this with a nav tag as the information below is navigation links for users to access different pages (navigation links). 
```md![image of naviagtion links](assets/images/navigation.png)```

- I modified the starter code to ensure that the code is of high quality so that if a image is not uploaded is has a description of what that image would be following best practice guidelines. I did this by adding the ***alt*** attribute for each image. 

- I added the ***main*** element as this specifies the ***main*** content of a document. HTML standards specifies that only one main element is to be included in a HTML document. ```md![image of main section](assets/images/main.png)```

- I added the ***aside*** element as the content in this section is a sidebar in this document ```md![image of aside section](assets/images/aside.png)```

- What i learned from completing this project was the importance user accessibility is to users. It will give users with disabilities the confidence to visit this website with no issues. I learned that by a website having best practice of accessibilty standards it is also better positioned in search engines like Google, achieves a higher ranking in search engine SERPs. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)is very important because it allows more traffic to the website.
